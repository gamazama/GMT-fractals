The central hub for creating motion. It allows you to animate almost any parameter in the application using keyframes.

## Layout
- **Toolbar**: Playback controls, Recording toggle, and View Modes.
- **Navigator**: The mini-map strip below the toolbar. 
  - **Scroll**: Drag the bar left/right.
  - **Zoom**: Drag the edges of the active window or use the scroll wheel.
- **Track List**: On the left. Shows all animated properties grouped by category (Camera, Formula, Optics, Lighting, Shading).
- **Work Area**: The main grid showing keys.
  - **Dope Sheet Mode**: View keyframes as discrete diamonds. Best for timing and retiming.
  - **Graph Editor Mode**: View keyframes as continuous curves. Best for easing and value adjustment.

## Basic Workflow
1. **Record**: Click the **Red Circle** button in the timeline toolbar.
2. **Move Playhead**: Drag the ruler to the desired frame.
3. **Change Value**: Move any slider (e.g., Param A, Light Intensity, Camera Position).
4. A keyframe is automatically created.
5. Move Playhead again and change value again.
6. Press **Space** to play.

## Selection & Editing
- **Click**: Select single key.
- **Shift+Click**: Add to selection.
- **Drag Box**: Select multiple keys.
- **Soft Selection**: A persistent toggle mode that can be enabled in the **Keyframe Inspector**. When active, moving a keyframe also influences nearby keys with a smooth falloff.
  - **Falloff Types**: Linear, Dome, S-Curve, Pinpoint.
  - **Radius**: Controls how far the influence extends. Adjust with **Ctrl+Drag**.
- **Copy/Paste**: Use **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** to duplicate keys (works across different tracks!). You can also right-click for **Duplicate Here**, or **Duplicate & Loop** (x2, x3, x4, x8) to repeat a pattern.
- **Delete**: Press Backspace/Delete.

- **Stop**: Return to frame 0.
- **Loop Toggle**: Switches between **Loop** (repeat forever) and **Once** (stop at end) playback modes.
- **Record (Red Circle)**: Toggles Auto-Keyframe mode.
  - When enabled, changing ANY slider or moving the camera will automatically create a keyframe at the current time position.
- **Modulation Record Arm**: Separate button for recording Audio/LFO modulation data.
- **Key Cam**: Manually captures the current camera state (Position + Rotation + Zoom) as a keyframe. Use this if you want to set a "pose" without moving the camera.
- **FRM**: Draggable frame counter for precise playhead positioning.
- **LEN**: Draggable duration control for setting the animation length.
- **Render**: Opens the Render/Export popup for video output.

        content: `
Each animated parameter has its own **Track**.

- **Creation**: Tracks are created automatically when you add a keyframe to a parameter.
- **Visibility**: Use the Eye icon in the Graph Editor sidebar to show/hide curves.
- **Grouping**: Tracks are automatically grouped by category (Camera, Formula, Optics, Lighting, Shading) in the Dope Sheet.

## Context Menu
Right-click a track header to access:
- **Delete Track**: Removes the track and all keyframes.

## Post Behavior
Determines what happens after the last keyframe. Access this from the **Graph Editor sidebar** context menu (right-click a track in the sidebar).
- **Hold**: Value stays constant.
- **Loop**: Animation repeats from the start.
- **Offset Loop (Relative)**: Repeats the animation but offsets each cycle so the end value of one loop becomes the start of the next. Useful for continuous rotation or steady movement.
- **Ping-Pong**: Animation reverses, then repeats.
- **Continue**: Value continues changing based on the exit velocity (Slope).

Keyframes store the value of a parameter at a specific time.

## Interpolation Types
Right-click a keyframe to change how the value moves *between* keys:
- **Bezier (Default)**: Smooth, curved transition. Customisable with handles in the Graph Editor.
- **Linear**: Straight line. Constant speed, sharp turns. Robotic movement.
- **Step**: Instant jump. The value holds constant until the next keyframe, then snaps instantly.

## Tangents (Graph Editor)
When using Bezier interpolation, handles control the curve slope:
- **Auto**: Automatically smooths the curve based on neighbors.
- **Flat (Ease)**: Flattens the slope to 0. Great for "Slow In / Slow Out".
- **Unified**: Both handles move together symmetrically, keeping a smooth curve while allowing manual adjustment.
- **Broken**: Allows sharp corners (incoming slope != outgoing slope).

A powerful F-Curve editor for fine-tuning motion dynamics.
Switch to this mode using the **Curve Icon** in the timeline toolbar.

## Toolbar Tools (Top Left)
- **Fit View / Selection**: Zooms the view to show all keys or just selected ones.
- **Normalize**: Toggles "Normalized View".
  - **Off**: Shows raw values. Good for seeing true scale.
  - **On**: Scales all curves to fit 0-1 height. Essential for comparing timing between tracks with vastly different values (e.g. Rotation vs Scale).
- **Euler Filter**: Fixes "Gimbal Lock" or rotation flips where values jump 360 degrees. Unwinds the curves to be continuous.
- **Simplify**: Drag to reduce the number of keyframes while preserving the curve shape.
- **Bake**: Resamples the curve at fixed intervals.
- **Smooth / Bounce**: Physics-based modifiers.
  - **Drag Right**: Applies Gaussian Smoothing to smooth out jitter.
  - **Drag Left**: Applies Spring Physics (Bounce) to create overshoot/elasticity.
  - Right-click for configurable physics settings: **Tension/Spring** and **Friction/Damping**.

## Curve Interaction
- **Select**: Click curve keys or drag a selection box.
- **Move**: Drag keys. Hold **Shift** to lock movement to X (Time) or Y (Value) axis.
- **Tangents**: Select a key to see its Bezier handles. Drag handles to adjust easing (Slow-in/Slow-out).
- **Extrapolation**: Dotted lines at the end of the curve visualize the Post Behavior (Loop, Ping-Pong, etc).

## Navigation
- **Alt + Right Drag**: Zoom view (Scale Time/Value).
- **Alt + Left Drag**: Pan view.
- **Middle Click Drag**: Pan view.
- **Double Click Ruler**: Fit view to all keyframes.

        content: `
Animating the camera in a fractal is complex due to the infinite scale.

## The "Unified" Camera Key
Unlike standard 3D software which tracks X/Y/Z, this engine tracks **Unified Coordinates** (Fractal Offset + Camera Local).
To keyframe the camera:
1. Move to a position you like.
2. Click the **"KEY CAM"** button in the Timeline Toolbar.
3. This creates keys for Position (Unified) and Rotation (Euler Angles) simultaneously.

## Path Interpolation
- The engine uses **Logarithmic Interpolation** for zoom levels. This ensures that zooming from 1.0 to 1,000,000.0 feels constant speed, rather than accelerating wildly.
- Use **Fly Mode** to record natural, handheld-like motion paths, then refine them in the Graph Editor using the **Smooth** tool.

        title: 'LFO Modulators',
        parentId: 'ui.timeline',
        content: `
Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) generate repeating waveforms that can be linked to any animatable parameter, creating organic, rhythmic motion without manually placing keyframes.

## Setup
You can add up to **3 LFO modulators** simultaneously.

## Waveform Shapes
- **Sine**: Smooth, continuous oscillation. Classic "breathing" motion.
- **Triangle**: Linear ramp up and down. Sharper transitions than Sine.
- **Sawtooth**: Ramps up linearly, then drops instantly. Good for repeating sweeps.
- **Pulse**: Switches between two values (on/off). Creates strobe-like effects.
- **Noise**: Random values each cycle. Adds natural variation and chaos.

## Parameters
- **Target**: The parameter to modulate (any slider in the application).
- **Period**: Length of one full cycle (in seconds). Lower = faster oscillation.
- **Strength**: How much the LFO affects the target value.
- **Phase Offset** (Advanced Mode): Shifts the starting point of the waveform. Useful for offsetting multiple LFOs from each other.
- **Smoothing**: Softens sharp transitions in the waveform.

## Waveform Preview
Each LFO displays a small real-time waveform visualization so you can see the shape and timing before applying it.

## Audio Links
LFOs can also be used as modulation sources in the Audio Links system, allowing audio-reactive control combined with oscillator patterns.

Renders your animation to a video file. Open the export popup using the **Render** button in the timeline toolbar.

## Resolution
Choose from built-in presets ranging from **720p** to **4K**, plus social media formats optimised for platforms like Instagram and YouTube.

## Quality Settings
- **Format**: Select the output video format.
- **Bitrate**: Controls the file size and compression quality.
- **Samples**: Number of render samples per frame. Higher values produce cleaner images but take longer.
- **Internal Scale (SSAA)**: Renders each frame at a higher resolution internally, then downscales for the final output. This is super-sampled anti-aliasing and produces much sharper results, especially on fine fractal detail.

## Frame Range
- **Start / End Frame**: Set which portion of the animation to render.
- **Frame Step**: Skip frames for faster preview renders (e.g., step 2 renders every other frame).

## Render Modes
- **RAM Mode**: Stores all rendered frames in memory, then encodes the video at the end. Faster encoding but uses more memory.
- **Disk Mode**: Writes each frame to disk as it renders. Uses less memory and is safer for long animations.

## Progress & Controls
- A progress bar shows the current frame, percentage complete, and estimated time remaining.
- **Interrupt**: Pause the render at any time.
- **Resume**: Continue a paused render from where it stopped.
- **Finish Early**: Encode whatever frames have been rendered so far into a shorter video.
- **Discard**: Cancel the render and discard all frames.
