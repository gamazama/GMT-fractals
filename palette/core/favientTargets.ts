/**
 * favientTargets — the Favients panel's per-HOST capability flags.
 *
 * The apply-target LIST this module used to own ("where a favourite applies") was folded
 * onto the engine send-target registry (`store/sendTargetRegistry`) in P2: every gradient
 * destination is now a `SendTarget` — `group: 'host'` for a host coloring layer, `'mode'`
 * for an intra-app surface (Generator slot, Stops, …). One registry, not two; the
 * `createListRegistry` kernel backs it. The panel reads `getSendTargets()` (filtered to
 * the host group) for its "Destination" dropdown.
 *
 * What remains here is host capability the generic registry can't express — the panel
 * still needs it to adapt to its embedding app:
 *   • select mode — does this host provide the select→reveal→place dock (the Explorer)?
 *   • browse / studio actions — the panel header's Palettes + open-studio buttons.
 *
 * Host-agnostic + side-effect-free at import: hosts set these in their own registration
 * step (the same place they register their send targets).
